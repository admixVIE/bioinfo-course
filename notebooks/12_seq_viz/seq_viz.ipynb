    "These proportions would tell you if something went wrong - and where it went wrong. A problem in library preparation may lead to high adapter abundance. DNA degradation may lead to small number of reads mapped, short reads or reads of low quality. PCR overamplification may lead to high numbers of duplicates, etc. It might be useful to look at this visually to check what is going on.\n",
