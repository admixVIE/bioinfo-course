    "* Framework and structures need to be first understood before you can ask ChatGPT for specific solutions.\n",
    "* You need to understand what each parameter of the applied tool does. If you don't know, read the docs rather than asking ChatGPT.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "* We use the command line to execute things in a Terminal.\n",
    "* There is a hierarchical file system: *directory/subdirectory/file.extension*.\n",
    "* This file system is underlying all systems, and the direct interface with a remote server.\n",
    "* Files are often very large and because of that compressed, marked wich extensions such as `.gz`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "* We execute *commands* with *-arguments* on *.files* (syntax). Commands take *input* and give *output*.\n",
    "* We can re-use commands (*Ctrl-C Ctrl-V!*; scrolling with cursor arrows), and autocomplete with *TAB* key.\n",
    "* This is not secret knowledge, but *open source*: most problems have been encountered before, so use *google* etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "* Basic commands for navigation: `cd `, `ls`, `pwd` etc.\n",
    "* Basic commands to look at files, copy, remove: `less`, `wc`, `head`, `cp`, `rm` etc.\n",
    "* Basic commands to subset/modify files: `grep`, `cut`, `awk`, `sort` etc.\n",
    "* Regular expressions allow complex arguments (for example for pattern search): `==`, `>=`, `&&`, `[0-9]`, `^` etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code and data\n",
    "\n",
    "* We use a GitHub repository for the code - git is the software to control code.\n",
    "* `R` can be used for statistics and visualisation (even as command line tool)!\n",
    "* QC of raw sequencing stats, filtering outcomes.\n",
    "* For example: Distribution of coverage is good to look at!\n"
